various python codes for acoustics and electroaocustics

HI! Welcome to the start of this repository.

I will try to commit various python codes I made that are useful for acoustics and particularly electroacoustics.

I'm still learning pyhton at the moment I'm writing these lines so it will be very basic but things should get more interesting in the following weeks / months so stay tuned.

For IMDEA / electroacoustics students wishing to contribute : feel free to contact me on facebook :)
